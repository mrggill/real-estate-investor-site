Clendenin/Getty Images\n\nNorth Texas housing could be even more expensive if not for new development in the sprawling suburbs, according to a new George W. Bush Institute report.\n\nWhy it matters: People want to move to Texas and specifically to the Dallas-Fort Worth region.\n\nThe latest: Dallas-Fort Worth and other Sun Belt metro areas offer more affordable houses and apartments than equally in-demand coastal cities, like San Francisco, because they have less-restrictive housing policies, the Bush Institute report found.\n\nStunning stat: If every large U.S. metro had similar housing policies to D-FW and other Sun Belt regions, about 5.6 million additional homes would have been built nationwide from 2010 to 2023.\n\nWhat they did: Economists with the nonpartisan independent policy institute at SMU analyzed population, income and real estate data from the 250 largest metro areas since 2010 to determine how cities are meeting the demand for housing.\n\nWhat they found: The U.S. population has shifted from the coasts and the northeast to Sun Belt cities in the South and mountain metros in the West.\n\nReality check: Though Sun Belt metros have more affordable real estate than restrictive coastal cities, housing in the Sun Belt still remains too expensive for people at the lowest income levels.\n\nZoom out: Charlotte, N.C., ranked as the No. 1 most pro-growth metro in the country due to how quickly the city has added housing to match its population growth.\n\nZoom in: Dallas-Fort Worth accounted for 5.1% of new housing production in the largest 250 U.S. metros from 2010-2023, per the report.\n\nBetween the lines: The housing growth hasn't come from increasing density in the core cities, like Dallas and Fort Worth. Most new housing has been added in suburbs and exurbs.\n\nWhat they're saying: Suburbs like Frisco and McKinney are successful because they allow mixed-use development, single-family housing and multifamily housing, which makes them more dense than suburbs outside of cities like Boston.\n\nGet more local stories in your inbox with Axios Dallas.\n\nGet a free daily digest of the most important news in your backyard with Axios Dallas.\n\nSupport local journalism by becoming a member.",

The project, with an estimated cost of $17.5 million, is expected to create or retain 170 jobs in Dallas. “This project is bringing new, high-paying and high-skill aviation repair jobs into Dallas,” said Councilmember Omar Narvaez (District 6), a member of the City Council’s Economic Development Committee. “I appreciate HAECO Global’s selection of Dallas and commitment to Dallas hiring.” HAECO Global will be leasing and occupying a 290,000 square foot newly built facility for the new engine support unit, which will be the primary location in North America for what is known as “engine hospital” repair work.   The work includes repair work for aircraft on the ground, larger repairs that may involve splitting engines into large components so they can be moved, or repair of internal components inside the engine that are then tested and reinstalled on the aircraft. HAECO Global will relocate 76 existing full-time jobs to the new Dallas facility from Carrollton and create an additional 94 jobs, for a total minimum job count of 170.  “We are thrilled to be partnering with the City of Dallas in this exciting venture,” said James Clarke, Executive Vice President of HAECO Global Engine Support. “This new location represents a tremendous opportunity for growth, both for our company and for the local community. It will bring high-quality jobs and support the development of cutting-edge technology that will shape the future of aviation.  Working with the leadership of the City’s business development group within the Office of Economic Development has been an extremely positive experience.” The City of Dallas will provide an economic development incentive grant of $500,000 if HAECO Global hires a workforce for the newly created jobs that consists of a minimum of 35% Dallas residents. If the local hiring is at least 25% Dallas residents, the grant will be $350,000. The 170 jobs must be created by December 31, 2027. Additionally, HAECO Global will participate in a workforce partnership program to help build a pipeline of skilled workers for these jobs.  “This project is a true win-win for our community,” said Kimberly Bizor Tolbert, Interim City Manager for the City of Dallas. “HAECO Global will provide high-skill and high paying jobs in Dallas, and by participating in a workforce partnership program, we are building a pipeline of Dallas workers for Dallas jobs.”",

    "content": "On December 11, the Dallas City Council unanimously approved a $49 million incentive package to support the development of the West End Lofts Project, a proposed mixed-use, mixed-income, and transit-oriented development project. The project will be developed on three existing parcels within the historic West End addressed as 805 Elm Street, 711 Elm Street, and 211 N. Austin Street within and adjacent to the City Center tax increment financing (TIF) district. The proposed project, led by Sycamore Strategies, LLC, is directly south of the West End DART light rail station and directly north of El Centro (Dallas College). “This is an exciting project that will convert underutilized/vacant historic buildings and surface parking lots into active residential and commercial uses abutting the West End DART light rail station and across the street from El Centro College,” said City Councilmember Paul Ridley (District 14), a member of the City Council’s Economic Development Committee. Council Member Ridley added, “With the reconstruction and expansion of the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center and impactful projects such as West End Lofts, we can expect to see significant positive changes to the west side of downtown Dallas over the next several years.” The estimated $103.2 million project will include 154 mixed-income apartments comprised of 56 efficiencies, 25 one-bedroom, 69 two-bedroom, and 4 three-bedroom units to be constructed within the historic 805 Elm Street building and in a new 6-story building to be constructed on the existing adjacent surface parking lot. Of the 154 apartments, 63 (41%) will be income-restricted and leased solely to households earning at or below 30%, 60%, 70%, and 80% area family median income. Additionally, the project will include the development of residential amenities, rehabilitation of approximately 26,462 gross square feet of ground floor retail/commercial space, creation of an approximately 25,751 square foot plaza and promenade (open space), and rehabilitation of approximately 140 parking spaces in the historic 711 Elm Street parking garage. The project’s funding includes $54,224,085 in non-City sources, including equity in the form of low income housing tax credits and historic rehabilitation tax credits. The City’s incentive package includes an amount not to exceed $28,275,676 in City Center TIF District funding as well as up to $20,724,324 from other economic development funding sources administered by the City’s Office of Economic Development, including general obligation bond proceeds from the economic development/housing propositions in the City’s 2012 and 2024 bond programs.  \"The West End Lofts development is about more than apartments to us. It is a chance to revitalize and transform an area of downtown with a brand new pedestrian plaza, street-level retail, workforce housing and the preservation of two pieces of Dallas history,\" said Zachary Krochtengel of Sycamore Strategies. \"The City of Dallas has been an essential and invaluable partner to us, and we are extremely grateful for their support.\"“The City’s dedication to working with the West End Lofts Project development team is a prime example of how public-private partnerships can bring meaningful development to areas in need of an economic development boost,” said Kimberly Bizor Tolbert, Interim City Manager for the City of Dallas. “This important project will provide much needed affordable housing and ground floor activation within downtown’s West End Historic District. Prior to City Council consideration of the City subsidy for the project, the City Center TIF District Board of Directors unanimously recommended the use of City Center TIF District funding for this project, with the added condition that best efforts be made to provide a minimum of two square feet per residential unit for pet relief facilities. It is exciting to think of adding housing stock that will be occupied with individuals, families, and their pets, helping to grow the live-work-play spirit of downtown Dallas.”",

While their main goal is to give patients investigational treatment options for memory loss, the team prides itself on connecting patients experiencing memory loss with resources in the community, even if KMC is not the right fit for the patient. The medical center is a valuable addition to the tenant mix at 4315 Innovation Center (a redevelopment project of the former Dallas-Area Urban League building) supported by the City of Dallas. On May 22, 2019, the Dallas City Council, through the City's Public-Private Partnership Program, approved a $750,000 economic development grant to E.

Revitalization of the previous vacant and poorly maintained building included various interior, exterior, and streetscape improvements including but not limited to mechanical systems, upgraded electrical wiring, upgraded restrooms for ADA compliance, complete roof replacement, sidewalk, parking, and landscaping. E.

Forest Forward has already invested over $15 million in selective demolition and environmental remediation efforts.“This project is revitalizing a cherished community asset, and its significance extends far beyond the theater itself,” said Deputy Mayor Pro Tem Adam Bazaldua (District 7), a member of the City Council’s Economic Development Committee. “While the physical restoration of the Forest Theater is vital, the real value lies in the community collaboration and the lasting positive impact this project will have for generations to come.”The project includes:Comprehensive rehabilitation of the 35,630-square-foot, 75-year-old Forest Theater, in accordance with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation. This will include the 500-seat main theater and lobby;New construction of an approximately 28,000-square-foot building addition to provide more lobby space and a 175-seat black box theater;Additional improvements, such as a café, rooftop deck, lawn for special events, and streetscape enhancements on Harwood Street to support public events and festivals.Upon completion, the redeveloped Forest Theater facility is expected to host more than 140 events annually.“With the support of the City of Dallas, the iconic Forest Theater will shine again in South Dallas.

The Infrastructure Investment Fund and the Community Development Program are part of new initiatives introduced last year under the City Council’s updated Economic Development and Incentive Policies, designed to address economic disparities and outcomes in historically underserved communities through strategic policy, public investment, and partnership.“Supporting a project like the Forest Theater is a prime example of why the City of Dallas updated its Economic Development Incentive Policy last year,” said Kimberly Bizor Tolbert, Interim City Manager for the City of Dallas. “Providing this funding to a valued non-profit partner like Forest Forward to support the revitalization of the Forest Theater aligns perfectly with the goals of our Office of Economic Development’s Community Development Program, and I’m thrilled that this project will be the first to benefit from our Infrastructure Investment Fund.”",

    "content": "Cabana Design District, a mixed-income housing development at 899 North Stemmons Freeway in the Design District, celebrated a groundbreaking on October 29th.  It will be a transformational historic rehabilitation and adaptive reuse of the former Cabana Hotel in the southern part of the Design District.The development will provide 175 multi-family units of which 40% or 70 units will be affordable at a range of income bands from 30% to 80% area median family income (AMFI) for 45 years. The total project cost is over $116 million and is supported by a City of Dallas subsidy of up to $41 million from the Design District Tax Increment Financing (TIF) District, approved by City Council in September 2023 (which includes funds for environmental remediation, public infrastructure improvements, and an economic development grant) as well as federal housing tax credits from the Texas Department of Housing & Community Affairs and federal/state historic tax credits.Sycamore Development, in partnership with Hunt Capital Partners, is the developer. The building has been vacant for more than 10 years and is on the National Register of Historic Places.The property was originally developed in 1962 as the Cabana Motor Court Hotel by Las Vegas hotelier Jay Sarno, and, in its heyday, was visited by celebrities like The Beatles and Led Zeppelin. A young Raquel Welch worked as a cocktail waitress in the “Bon Vivant Room.” Many of the historic features will be brought back to life in this catalyst project that will provide much needed affordable housing near high opportunity areas.",
