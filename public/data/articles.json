Apple announced plans to open an advanced manufacturing facility in the Houston region. Part of a $500 billion national investment, the new 250,000-square-foot facility will bring AI-driven manufacturing to Houston, reshoring critical operations from overseas. \n\nThe facility, set to open in 2026, will focus on the production of servers that support Apple Intelligence, the tech giant’s AI software system. By relocating this key manufacturing process from abroad to the U.S., Apple is making a strong statement about Houston's role in the future of American high-tech manufacturing. \n\nLearn more about Houston’s manufacturing industry. \n\nA Booming Manufacturing Hub \n\nAccording to the Greater Houston Partnership, Houston is home to over 7,000 manufacturers, producing more than $75.1 billion in goods annually. Houston ranks as the second top U.S. metro for manufacturing GDP, solidifying its reputation as a leader in industrial production. \n\n“This is a testament to our region’s business-friendly environment, skilled workforce, strategic global positioning, and proven ability to attract world-class companies,” said Greater Houston Partnership President and CEO Steve Kean. “As U.S. companies continue to onshore their manufacturing operations, we are bullish on Houston’s ability to win big.” \n\nEconomic Impact and Growth Potential \n\nApple’s decision to expand in Houston is expected to have a ripple effect throughout the local economy. While some details of the project remain confidential, Apple said in a press release the Houston facility \"will create thousands of jobs.\" Additionally, the facility will support local suppliers and drive further investment in AI-driven manufacturing. \n\nBuilding Strategic Partnerships \n\nThe Apple announcement is an expansion of a multi-building manufacturing complex managed by Foxconn in northwest Harris County, which produces high-tech components for numerous global technology companies, including Apple. Foxconn’s parent company, Taiwan-based Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., announced in November that it was expanding its Houston presence by acquiring land and a facility to enhance its artificial intelligence server production in the U.S. That specific expansion project is expected to create 300 jobs with $225 million in capital investment. \n\nThe Partnership has been cultivating a relationship with Foxconn over the past several years. This includes an in-person visit with the company in Taiwan during last year’s economic development mission with Governor Greg Abbott. This type of strategic relationship-building continues to be a key driver in attracting world-class companies to the region. \n\nAs more companies seek to strengthen their supply chains and expand AI-driven production, Houston is poised to lead the next wave of industrial innovation.  \n\nShare this Blog Post\nContinue Reading\nECONOMY MANUFACTURING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT\nExplore Houston.org\nWHY HOUSTON\n\nDiscover what makes Houston attractive to companies from a wide range of sectors.\n\nLearn More\nLIVING IN HOUSTON\n\nThere is no limit to what Houston offers residents.

From the oil rigs that powered the 20th century to the rockets that carried us to the moon, this region has built its reputation on the ability to engineer, innovate and scale at every level of industry.  Tech manufacturing has always been a part of that story. Before Silicon Valley became synonymous with the tech boom, there was Compaq. In the 1980s and ’90s, the Houston-based company helped revolutionize personal computing, turning the region into a hub for high-tech production long before it became a national trend.   Hewlett-Packard and Texas Instruments also maintained a significant presence in the region during that era. But as manufacturing policies and global economic dynamics shifted production overseas, Houston’s momentum in tech manufacturing slowed.  Now, as the global manufacturing landscape shifts toward advanced technologies like AI systems, robotics, energy storage and digital infrastructure, some of the world’s most prominent names in tech are turning their attention back to Houston.  Want to learn more about Houston’s advanced manufacturing industry? Connect with the Partnership’s Sr. Director of Economic Development, Valerie Mathieu.   Strategic Investments  Earlier this year, Apple announced it would build a 250,000-square-foot AI-driven manufacturing facility in northwest Harris County, bringing advanced server production for its Apple Intelligence platform back to U.S. soil. The announcement is an expansion of a multi-building complex operated by Foxconn, which supplies high-tech components for global tech firms.  Nvidia, a global leader in AI computing, also recently announced plans to reshore production of its AI supercomputers to the U.S., with a new manufacturing facility in Houston in partnership with Foxconn. These high-performance systems are essential for powering the next generation of data centers.  “Nvidia’s announcement reinforces a growing trend—global companies are choosing Houston for advanced manufacturing,\" said Craig Rhodes, Greater Houston Partnership’s SVP of Economic Development, in a statement. “Our region has the key ingredients—a highly skilled and diverse workforce, robust infrastructure, and deep industry expertise—to scale complex projects. As demand for AI and digital technologies grows, Houston is where companies come to build the future.”  Why Houston, Why Now?  As global companies re-evaluate supply chains, the question isn’t just where to build – but where to build smart. Houston offers the full package: scalable infrastructure, a strong supply chain ecosystem and a skilled workforce ready for next-gen production.  With nearly 240,000 manufacturing workers, Houston has one of the most diverse and capable labor pools in the nation – strengthened by industry-aligned training programs at local collages and new outcomes-based funding under Texas House Bill 8.   Innovation hubs, like The Ion District, accelerate the pace from idea to market, while Houston’s logistics network – home to the nation’s busiest port for foreign tonnage and two international airports – ensure global connectivity.  Add pro-business policies, available land and lower costs than coastal hubs, and Houston stands out as one of the fastest, smartest places to grow.  Leading the Future  The latest wave of investments from Apple and NVIDIA aren’t just one-off wins; they’re a bold statement of confidence in Houston’s ability to deliver the talent, infrastructure and innovation needed to lead the next era of high-tech manufacturing.  \nRead More\nECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT\nReport: Houston's Global Strengths Position Region to Navigate Trade Uncertainty\n5/1/25\nHOUSTON (May 1, 2025)—As evolving trade policies and geopolitical tensions create economic uncertainty in 2025, Houston enters the year with a strong foundation. According to the Greater Houston Partnership’s newly released 2025 Global Houston report, the region led the U.S. in exports last year – shipping $180.9 billion in goods, more than any other metro area. Click to expand   The report, based on 2024 data compiled prior to this year’s policy changes, highlights how Houston’s infrastructure, industrial base and deep global relationships position the region to better navigate trade disruptions.  “As the U.S. seeks fairer trade arrangements, the uncertainty is impacting some long-term investment decisions,” Partnership President and CEO Steve Kean said. “At the same time, we’re seeing increased interest in the Houston metro as a destination for onshoring. Our region enters this period from a position of strength – we’re not only the nation’s top exporting metro, but also a leader in population and GDP growth. Houston is well-positioned to adapt, respond and benefit from global economic shifts.” Notably, the Houston/Galveston Customs District is one of only 10 in the U.S. where exports exceed imports – a reflection of the region’s strong global demand and production capacity. Key Metrics from the Global Houston Report: #1 U.S. Exporting Metro: $180.9B in goods exported in 2024 (3.1% increase from 2023) Record Customs District Tonnage: 432.6M metric tons handled, ranking No. 1 nationally Total Trade Value: $376.3B through Houston/Galveston, ranking No. 4 among U.S. districts Foreign Direct Investment: 81 foreign-owned companies announced plans to relocate, expand or start operations; a 56% increase from 2023 when 52 international projects were announced. (increase is partially due to improved data sourcing) Global Connectivity: 3.1M international passengers traveled through Houston airports (record; a 4.2% increase over the 12.6 million passengers in ’23) 3.4M container units processed at Port Houston (record) Migration-Driven Workforce Growth: Nearly 65% of the region’s 2024 population growth came from international migration Energy Leads in Exports Energy continues to play an outsized role in Houston’s international economy. Oil and refined petroleum products accounted for more than half (52.1%) of all trade value flowing through the Houston/Galveston Customs District in 2024 – totaling $196.1B, with 88% of that volume heading overseas.  According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), global oil demand is expected to reach 103.6 million barrels per day in 2025 – a new record, though below earlier projections. At the same time, lower forecasted oil prices and emerging trade barriers could prompt Texas producers to scale back new drilling, potentially reducing export volumes through the Houston/Galveston District.

As renewable energy sources become more prevalent, BESS provides a complementary yet critical solution for storing excess energy during peak production and releasing it when demand is high or generation is low. These systems enhance grid stability through a diversification of power sources.\n\nAs these sources continue to grow into prominence, we have seen their positive impact in the region. With a growing push for resiliency, these systems will strengthen Houston’s quality of life as well as its local business environment.\n\nWhile BESS can provide the Houston region benefits, the Houston region also offers a lot to this growing energy solution. Given the wealth of energy leadership, Texas isn’t just the nation’s energy powerhouse - it’s the perfect ecosystem for BESS innovation. Here’s why:\n\nEnergy Market Leadership\nTexas is home to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), one of the most dynamic and competitive energy markets in the world. ERCOT’s grid provides a fertile ground for the integration of BESS, enabling grid resilience and reducing costs.\nRenewable Energy Growth\nAs per the Energy Information Administration (EIA) - the Lone Star state has 42,000 megawatts (MW) of wind power, 22,000 MW of solar farms and 6,500 MW of utility-scale battery capacity in place as of the end of 2024 – thus dominating the development of renewable energy generation and battery capacity within the United States.\nRegulatory and Economic Incentives\nPrograms like the Texas Energy Fund (TEF), coupled with local initiatives, create an enabling environment for developers.\nStrategic Geography and Expertise\nThe Greater Houston Region offers unparalleled infrastructure, skilled labor, and proximity to industrial hubs, making it a natural choice for BESS investments.\n\nHouston Region: The Emerging Epicenter of BESS\n\nAs the Energy Capital of the World, Houston is uniquely positioned to lead this transformative sector of BESS, leveraging high growth, grid demand, and strategic projects across the Greater Houston region.\n\nFrom League City’s 150 MW project to Texas City’s groundbreaking initiatives and Galveston County’s Gridstor project (to name a few), Houston is laying the foundation for a resilient energy future.\n\nKey Projects Powering BESS Momentum\n\n1. League City: Fostering community engagement\nThe recent approval of a 150 MW Peregrine Energy facility in League City exemplifies how the city is setting the standard for sustainable energy development. Working closely with the community and stakeholders provided opportunities to address concerns of the residents and pave the way for transformative investments in the greater Houston region.\n\nThe city’s forward-thinking ordinance re energy storage includes:\n\nPlume modeling and 24/7 monitoring to ensure safety.\nEmergency response plans and comprehensive decommissioning requirements.\nTransparent engagement with residents to address concerns and build trust.\n\nThese efforts transformed the initial community pushback into support, highlighting how thoughtful regulation and outreach can lead to success. Additionally, a 10 MW BESS facility, regulated by the city, further demonstrates how the Greater Houston region is scaling energy storage to meet growing demands.\n\n2. Texas City: Scaling Ambition\n\nTexas City is attracting large-scale energy storage projects which will play a crucial role in grid reliability and energy transition. Historically, strict zoning regulations posed challenges for BESS projects, but the city is now transitioning to a Site Plan approval process, making it easier for BESS projects to set up operations while maintaining safety standards.\n\nAdditionally, Texas City has been collaborating with Bluestem Energy Solutions to refine its approach to BESS implementation, ensuring smoother project approvals and better integration with local energy infrastructure.\n\nThe city is also prioritizing community engagement and conversations with industry experts to train its staff while working closely with fire safety professionals to address potential hazards, reinforcing its commitment to both innovation and safety in the energy transition.\n\n3. Galveston County: Expanding Regional Impact\nGalveston County continues to attract strategic BESS investments, including the Gridstor Battery Energy Storage Project, which recently started construction. This facility is expected to enhance grid reliability and support renewable energy integration across the Greater Houston region.\n\nAdditionally, the Shepard Energy Storage project is advancing efforts to bolster energy stability in Galveston County, emphasizing the importance of energy storage in maintaining grid resilience.\n\nThese projects illustrate how high growth and intense grid demand drive companies to locate here, even without significant tax abatements.\n\n4. City of Houston: The first large-scale BESS\n\nThe City of Houston is now home to the first battery storage project of its scale, with the Jupiter Power 200MW/400MWh Callisto I Energy Center. Operational as of summer 2024, this project provides potential for stability and resiliency with any extreme weather affecting the area.\n\nHow the Greater Houston Partnership is Driving Growth\n\nThe Partnership is committed to ensuring the region remains a global leader in energy storage.\n\nHere’s how the Partnership is advancing this vision:\n\nEngaging communities and stakeholders\nAs the world transitions to energy-abundant, low-carbon energy solutions, the Partnership’s Houston Energy Transition Initiative (HETI) collaborated with the Houston Advanced Research Center (HARC), Sallie Greenberg Consulting (SGC) and released a Climate Equity Report, which includes the Framework for an Equitable Energy Transition and the Community Engagement Toolkit. This was developed to help foster positive, two-way communication and engagement between Houston-area energy companies and the communities they impact. \nAdvocating for supportive policies and ensuring strategic partnerships\nStrengthening Houston's thriving business environment is critical to our members' mission of making Houston the best place to live, work and build a business.\nThe Partnership collaborates with stakeholders and advocates for strong public policy at all levels of government that fosters long-term growth and upward economic mobility for the region.\nPreparing a workforce that is equitable and inclusive\nThrough initiatives like UpSkill Houston and One Houston Together, the Partnership ensures the region’s workforce is ready to meet the demands of emerging technologies like BESS.\n\nThe Path Forward\n\nHouston’s leadership in BESS is transforming the energy landscape, and the region is setting a national standard for innovation, community engagement, and economic growth. HETI is supporting these efforts to ensure Houston remains at the forefront of the energy transition.\n\nAs BESS becomes an essential tool for grid resilience and emission reductions, Houston is poised to power the future.\n\nTo learn more about the all-inclusive energy ecosystem in Houston, visit our energy focus page.\n\nShare this Blog Post\nContinue Reading\nENERGY\nExplore Houston.org\nWHY HOUSTON\n\nDiscover what makes Houston attractive to companies from a wide range of sectors.\n\nLearn More\nLIVING IN HOUSTON\n\nThere is no limit to what Houston offers residents.

That’s why continuing to improve funding for education and strengthening the accountability system are top priorities for the Greater Houston Partnership. Whether you are a veteran in education policy or looking for a refresher ahead of the 89th Texas Legislature, here are five questions to get you thinking about how we approach education in Texas.\n \nHow is public education funded in Texas?\n\nPublic Education in Texas is funded from three sources: \n\n Local property taxes \nDetermined by the value of properties in each district and the tax rate set by each school board.\nState appropriations\nFunded through numerous state taxes, including Texas’ sales tax.\nFederal appropriations\nIt broadly covers the costs of providing meals and supporting disabled and low-income students.\nWhat happened with education funding in the 2023 Texas Legislative Session?\n\nLegislators made several attempts to increase public school funding in 2023 via numerous bills. For example, HB100 would have raised the basic allotment (baseline per-pupil funding) for the first time since 2019. HB4586 would have mandated annual increases to the basic allotment. SB9 would have raised teacher salaries and expanded funding for early childhood education. These bills eventually failed due to political differences and the legislative session’s very short 140-day timeline.\n\nAdditional education funding was provided in other ways, however: \n\nHB1605 provided additional funding to schools that adopt high-quality instructional materials, and HB3 provided additional funds for school safety. \nHow do we maintain or strengthen accountability for education across Texas?\n\nSchool accountability is about more than just a grade – school accountability happens when families and stakeholders are provided clear and accurate data on schools, schools receive ratings based on students’ academic proficiency, and there are consequences – high-performing schools are rewarded and recognized. In contrast, low-performing schools are required to implement intervention plans.\n\nHow do we measure success in Public Education, and what policies can improve outcomes? \n\nPublic Education is successful when it prepares students to succeed upon graduation, whether through college, a career, or the military. Student outcomes can be improved through policies prioritizing high academic proficiency, school safety, and teacher recruitment and retention.\n\nWhat other education policy discussions will be popular in Austin this session?\n\nAI’s integration into education will be an essential issue to watch. AI has many applications to assist teachers and students, and schools are eager to embrace the new technology. \n\nTeacher workforce issues will also be a central topic. Texas has been working to improve teacher recruitment and retention for several years, and those conversations are expected to continue in 2025.\n\nLearn more about the Partnership's Legislative Priorities, click here. For more updates and alerts on the Texas Legislature, click here to sign up for our weekly newsletter.\n\nShare this Blog Post\nContinue Reading\nPUBLIC POLICY EDUCATION\nExplore Houston.org\nWHY HOUSTON\n\nDiscover what makes Houston attractive to companies from a wide range of sectors.\n\nLearn More\nLIVING IN HOUSTON\n\nThere is no limit to what Houston offers residents.

Both the board and administration should be commended for vision and leadership, but the real gratitude should go to the principals, teachers, and staff who have put the changes into practice; elevating expectations and improving the academic trajectories of the students in schools the district had failed for many years. Commissioner Morath is right to extend the period of reform to ensure these improvements take hold long-term, significantly impacting generations of students. We also extend sincere gratitude to the four outgoing board members who have admirably led the district under sometimes trying circumstances. And we commend the four newly appointed board members who have answered the call to serve students and keep the district on a positive trajectory. The next two years will be a pivotal time for the district, and we are eager to work with the refreshed board and administration to make the most of a generational opportunity to improve student success.”   MEDIA CONTACT: Brina Morales                                                 Sr. Director, Communications     bmorales@houston.org\nRead More\nPUBLIC POLICY\nHouston’s Impact in Austin: Legislative Wins from the 89th Session\n6/2/25\nAs the 89th Texas Legislative Session concludes, several key policy measures aligned with the Greater Houston Partnership’s priorities were advanced. With 1 in 4 Texas jobs based in the Houston metro, a nearly $650+ billion regional GDP, and more than 1.2 million students enrolled in regional public education institutions, Houston plays an outsized role in shaping the future of our state. Legislative decisions made in Austin ripple through our 12-county region impacting infrastructure, education, innovation and the workforce that powers Texas. Guided by our Executive Priorities, Water Infrastructure, Education, and Workforce Development, and powered by our elected officials, members and partners, the Partnership worked throughout the session to advocate for policies that will strengthen the greater Houston region and the state. Executive Priority Wins Water Infrastructure A generational investment in Texas’ water future, anchored by a proposed constitutional amendment to dedicate $1 billion annually over the next 20 years, was one of the session’s biggest wins. $265 million+ secured for Houston-area water and flood mitigation projects, including $100 million for the Lynchburg Pump Station. The creation of a new Lake Houston Dredging and Maintenance District to fund ongoing operations A dedicated fund for the Gulf Coast Protection District to continue delivering $550 million for projects to make the coastline and ship channel more resilient Public Education This session delivered the largest infusion of new programmatic funding in more than a decade.  $195 million+ for Houston ISD under a new school finance formula and pay raises for Texas teachers. Higher Education Houston’s institutions saw record-breaking support in recognition of their role in talent development, research, and medical innovation. $2.1 billion+ for Houston area four-year colleges and universities.  Workforce Development With a growing emphasis on applied learning and employer-aligned training, Texas made strong investments in talent development. HB 120 + HB 20 + SB 1786 expanded access to school-to-career programs and career-focused science pathways, and continued the work at community and junior colleges to deliver more credentials of value Investing in What’s Next The Partnership also supported forward-looking policies that position Houston and Texas for long-term growth: $3 billion to launch the Dementia Prevention and Research Institute (DRPIT). $715 million in funding for nuclear energy, semiconductors, and emerging industries. These wins were only possible through deep collaboration, among our coalition partners, elected officials, business and community leaders, and the engaged members of the Partnership. Together, we’ve demonstrated how a united voice for Houston helps drive results that benefit all Texans. We are grateful for the leadership of our regional delegation and statewide champions who delivered these critical investments. Click here to download the 89th Texas Legislative Session Summary.

Photo: Jacek Boczarski/Anadolu via Getty Images\n\nThe Dallas Mavericks will have the No. 1 pick in the 2025 NBA draft in June.\n\nWhy it matters: It's the first time that the Mavericks have ever won the first pick in the draft lottery.\n\nAnd the timing is uncanny: The team is still rebounding from one of the wildest trade in NBA history — sending Luka Dončić to the Lakers — and missing this year's playoffs after making it to the NBA Finals last year.\n\nFun fact: The Mavericks had a 1.8% chance of getting the first pick Monday night.\n\nState of play: If the Mavericks don't trade their pick, Dallas could end up with the top players in both men's and women's college basketball.\n\nThe Dallas Wings also had the No. 1 pick this year and selected Paige Bueckers last month.\nThe Mavs now have the chance to add Duke freshman Cooper Flagg, the 2024-25 National Player of the Year, to their roster.\n\nWhat they're saying: Even before the lottery, fans were saying Dallas should trade to get Luka back if they won the No. 1 pick.\n\n\"God please reward us for all the pain we've been through,\" a fan wrote on the team's Instagram post explaining how the lottery works.\n\nBetween the lines: Mark Cuban broke the news to team governor Patrick Dumont, who was watching one of his kids compete in a track meet, per DMN reporter Brad Townsend.\n\nCuban was screaming so much, Dumont couldn't make out the words at first.\n\nZoom in: Flagg has been the presumed No. 1 pick since last summer, when he held his own on the practice U.S. Olympic squad as a 17-year-old.\n\nAfter a stellar college season, the 6-foot-9 forward is seen by some scouts as a bona fide franchise player, while others see him as an elite second star, per ESPN.\n\nWhat's next: The first round of the draft takes place June 25.\n\nfacebook (opens in new window)\ntwitter (opens in new window)\nlinkedin (opens in new window)\nnextdoor (opens in new window)\nemail (opens in new window)\n\nGet more local stories in your inbox with Axios Dallas.\n\nSubscribe\nMore Dallas stories\nNews\nMaking Dallas a tourist destination\nMay 9, 2025\nGo deeper (1 min. read)\nPolitics & Policy\nFormer Dallas bishop temporarily leads Catholic Church\nApr 21, 2025\nGo deeper (1 min. read)\nNews\nMore anti-Trump protests planned in Dallas-Fort Worth\nApr 17, 2025\nGo deeper (1 min. read)\nNews\nWhy Dallas-Fort Worth embraces the sprawl\nMay 1, 2025\nGo deeper (2 min. read)\nNews\nWhat's on the May 3 ballot in Dallas-Fort Worth\nApr 30, 2025\nGo deeper (1 min. read)\nMore stories\n\nGet a free daily digest of the most important news in your backyard with Axios Dallas.\n\nSubscribe\n🌱\n\nSupport local journalism by becoming a member.\n\nLearn more",

Photo: Ronald Martinez/Allsport\n\nAmerica's Team will play America's No. 1 team in the NFL's 2025-26 season opener, the league announced Monday.\n\nWhy it matters: The Dallas Cowboys and Philadelphia Eagles have been rivals for decades but haven't faced off in Week 1 in 25 years.\n\nDallas will play at Philly on Sept. 4 in the season's first NFL game, intended to get football fans excited for the upcoming season.\n\nThe big picture: The Eagles are coming off a Super Bowl championship. The Cowboys are rebuilding after playing without quarterback Dak Prescott for months and ending last season 7-10.\n\nFlashback: Temperatures reached 109 degrees — even hotter on the turf —when the rivals last played on opening weekend on Sept. 3, 2000.\n\nThe matchup at Texas Stadium was the hottest game in NFL history. Eagles players used pickle juice to reduce muscle cramping, and won 41-14.\nCowboys quarterback Troy Aikman retired after the season ended.\n\nThe intrigue: Star Cowboys linebacker Micah Parsons will play against the team he grew up watching.\n\n\"Yeah yeah let's ball 😮‍💨🦁,\" the linebacker wrote on his Instagram story after the game was announced.\n\nBetween the lines: The Cowboys' viewership may have contributed to the NFL's decision to put them in the opening game.\n\nThe team averaged around 22.5 million national TV viewers last season, the NFL's second-highest viewership, per Sportico.\n\nState of play: The Eagles will have the upper hand as the defending Super Bowl champs, but there's still hope for the Cowboys.\n\nFormer offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer will debut as head coach, Prescott is expected to play, and wide receiver CeeDee Lamb will have help from newly acquired George Pickens.\n\nWhat's next: The game will air on NBC and Peacock.

The ratings will be finalized in August.\n\nWhat they're doing: The district tells Axios in a statement that it has restructured its literacy and math curriculum and has a new strategic plan that includes academic performance, family engagement, employee retention and operational efficiency.\n\nThe district also has a new superintendent.\n\nThe fine print: State law requires the TEA to take over a district if any of its campuses get an unacceptable rating for five consecutive years.\n\nTakeovers typically replace the elected board of trustees and superintendent with a state-appointed board of managers and can affect students and staff if schools are closed or turned into charters.\nThe TEA decides when to return control to elected trustees.\n\nBetween the lines: It's rare for the state to take control of a school district.\n\nFrom 1993 to 2023, the state took over a school district 15 times, per the Houston Chronicle.\n\nZoom out: Houston ISD has been under state control since 2023 and could stay under state control until at least 2027, per the Texas Standard.\n\nThe state also took over South San Antonio ISD in February, citing years of governance failures and financial mismanagement.\n\nWhat's next: The TEA's 2024 ratings are delayed by a different lawsuit and haven't been released.\n\nfacebook (opens in new window)\ntwitter (opens in new window)\nlinkedin (opens in new window)\nnextdoor (opens in new window)\nemail (opens in new window)\n\nGet more local stories in your inbox with Axios Dallas.\n\nSubscribe\nMore Dallas stories\nNews\nMaking Dallas a tourist destination\nMay 9, 2025\nGo deeper (1 min. read)\nPolitics & Policy\nFormer Dallas bishop temporarily leads Catholic Church\nApr 21, 2025\nGo deeper (1 min. read)\nNews\nMore anti-Trump protests planned in Dallas-Fort Worth\nApr 17, 2025\nGo deeper (1 min. read)\nNews\nWhy Dallas-Fort Worth embraces the sprawl\nMay 1, 2025\nGo deeper (2 min. read)\nNews\nWhat's on the May 3 ballot in Dallas-Fort Worth\nApr 30, 2025\nGo deeper (1 min. read)\nMore stories\n\nGet a free daily digest of the most important news in your backyard with Axios Dallas.\n\nSubscribe\n🌱\n\nSupport local journalism by becoming a member.\n\nLearn more",

Nature, like Five Mile Creek, is tucked in there too. Photo: Tasha Tsiaperas/Axios\n\nThe average temperature in Dallas-Fort Worth was nearly 6 degrees warmer than normal last month, per the National Weather Service, but some neighborhoods likely felt much hotter.\n\nWhy it matters: Dallas has mapped its heat islands for two years now, helping city planners determine which neighborhoods need more trees.\n\nConcrete urban settings can make a hot day feel worse, while tree-lined streets and less concrete can have a cooling effect.\n\nThe big picture: Urban heat islands are a problem nationwide, but the burden isn't equally shared. Historically segregated neighborhoods tend to experience higher temperatures than white communities.\n\nResearchers have released reports illustrating heat disparity in other U.S. cities this year, including Charlotte, North Carolina, and Santa Fe, New Mexico.\n\nDriving the news: Lush green space in Dallas was about 12 degrees cooler than the hottest parts of town on Aug. 10, 2024, when the temperature reached 101 degrees.\n\nAn updated joint study by the City of Dallas and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has now mapped 350 square miles of the city over two years to identify the hottest neighborhoods.\n\nWhat they found: Built-up areas around highways and major roads stayed hot throughout the day, whereas neighborhoods near preserved land with a lot of trees on their streets stayed cooler.\n\nThe difference can be seen in North Oak Cliff, where Bishop Arts was hotter than the neighborhood around nearby Stevens Park.\nDowntown, Oak Lawn, the Harwood area, West Dallas and Love Field are among the hottest areas.\n\nThe intrigue: Some Dallas neighborhoods can be in the low 70s at 6am while hotter neighborhoods start the day above 82 degrees.\n\nThreat level: Even with reduced emissions, researchers write, temperatures are still expected to rise in the coming decades.\n\nWith high emissions, the average daily maximum temperature could increase 4 degrees by the 2060s. Even with low emissions, the temperature could rise 2 degrees.\nDallas County could see 10 more days a year with a high over 90 degrees within 20 years.\n\nThe bottom line: City leaders plan to use the data to plant more trees in neighborhoods that have been identified as heat islands.\n\nThe city is already prioritizing adding park space to give every resident access to greenspace within a short walk from their home.\n\nGo deeper: See how hot your neighborhood is.\n\nfacebook (opens in new window)\ntwitter (opens in new window)\nlinkedin (opens in new window)\nnextdoor (opens in new window)\nemail (opens in new window)\n\nGet more local stories in your inbox with Axios Dallas.\n\nSubscribe\nMore Dallas stories\nNews\nMaking Dallas a tourist destination\nMay 9, 2025\nGo deeper (1 min. read)\nPolitics & Policy\nFormer Dallas bishop temporarily leads Catholic Church\nApr 21, 2025\nGo deeper (1 min. read)\nNews\nMore anti-Trump protests planned in Dallas-Fort Worth\nApr 17, 2025\nGo deeper (1 min. read)\nNews\nWhy Dallas-Fort Worth embraces the sprawl\nMay 1, 2025\nGo deeper (2 min. read)\nNews\nWhat's on the May 3 ballot in Dallas-Fort Worth\nApr 30, 2025\nGo deeper (1 min. read)\nMore stories\n\nGet a free daily digest of the most important news in your backyard with Axios Dallas.\n\nSubscribe\n🌱\n\nSupport local journalism by becoming a member.\n\nLearn more",

We're becoming kind of the epicenter for that. Certainly, we're a global city,\" the mayor said at an event where he talked about the city's growth.\nThe Dallas Sports Commission refers to the region as \"DFW-AF\" as it prepares for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, executive director Monica Paul said at a separate event hosted by D Magazine last month.\n\"It takes everybody and every city — but it's also the conferences, the universities, our corporations, the facilities, and our leagues and teams here,\" Paul said.\n\nFlashback: Last year, Arlington Mayor Jim Ross disagreed with FIFA's decision to rename AT&T Stadium to Dallas Stadium for the nine World Cup matches that will be hosted there.\n\n\"Dallas is the big boy in the metroplex, and we love and appreciate everything Dallas does, but Arlington brings millions of millions of people here. To come in and call this Dallas Stadium doesn't do justice for who we are,\" Ross told the DMN.\n\nReality check: Plano could use more love, too.

    "content": "On December 11, the Dallas City Council unanimously approved a $49 million incentive package to support the development of the West End Lofts Project, a proposed mixed-use, mixed-income, and transit-oriented development project. The project will be developed on three existing parcels within the historic West End addressed as 805 Elm Street, 711 Elm Street, and 211 N. Austin Street within and adjacent to the City Center tax increment financing (TIF) district. The proposed project, led by Sycamore Strategies, LLC, is directly south of the West End DART light rail station and directly north of El Centro (Dallas College). “This is an exciting project that will convert underutilized/vacant historic buildings and surface parking lots into active residential and commercial uses abutting the West End DART light rail station and across the street from El Centro College,” said City Councilmember Paul Ridley (District 14), a member of the City Council’s Economic Development Committee. Council Member Ridley added, “With the reconstruction and expansion of the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center and impactful projects such as West End Lofts, we can expect to see significant positive changes to the west side of downtown Dallas over the next several years.” The estimated $103.2 million project will include 154 mixed-income apartments comprised of 56 efficiencies, 25 one-bedroom, 69 two-bedroom, and 4 three-bedroom units to be constructed within the historic 805 Elm Street building and in a new 6-story building to be constructed on the existing adjacent surface parking lot. Of the 154 apartments, 63 (41%) will be income-restricted and leased solely to households earning at or below 30%, 60%, 70%, and 80% area family median income. Additionally, the project will include the development of residential amenities, rehabilitation of approximately 26,462 gross square feet of ground floor retail/commercial space, creation of an approximately 25,751 square foot plaza and promenade (open space), and rehabilitation of approximately 140 parking spaces in the historic 711 Elm Street parking garage. The project’s funding includes $54,224,085 in non-City sources, including equity in the form of low income housing tax credits and historic rehabilitation tax credits. The City’s incentive package includes an amount not to exceed $28,275,676 in City Center TIF District funding as well as up to $20,724,324 from other economic development funding sources administered by the City’s Office of Economic Development, including general obligation bond proceeds from the economic development/housing propositions in the City’s 2012 and 2024 bond programs.  \"The West End Lofts development is about more than apartments to us. It is a chance to revitalize and transform an area of downtown with a brand new pedestrian plaza, street-level retail, workforce housing and the preservation of two pieces of Dallas history,\" said Zachary Krochtengel of Sycamore Strategies. \"The City of Dallas has been an essential and invaluable partner to us, and we are extremely grateful for their support.\"“The City’s dedication to working with the West End Lofts Project development team is a prime example of how public-private partnerships can bring meaningful development to areas in need of an economic development boost,” said Kimberly Bizor Tolbert, Interim City Manager for the City of Dallas. “This important project will provide much needed affordable housing and ground floor activation within downtown’s West End Historic District. Prior to City Council consideration of the City subsidy for the project, the City Center TIF District Board of Directors unanimously recommended the use of City Center TIF District funding for this project, with the added condition that best efforts be made to provide a minimum of two square feet per residential unit for pet relief facilities. It is exciting to think of adding housing stock that will be occupied with individuals, families, and their pets, helping to grow the live-work-play spirit of downtown Dallas.”",

    "content": "On November 13,  the Dallas City Council unanimously approved an $8 million community development grant to support Forest Forward’s redevelopment of the historic Forest Theater, a key cultural and physical asset that has been closed since 2008.  Located at 1918 Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard in South Dallas’s Forest District, the theater is the focal point of a revitalization project estimated to cost $81 million. Forest Forward has already invested over $15 million in selective demolition and environmental remediation efforts.“This project is revitalizing a cherished community asset, and its significance extends far beyond the theater itself,” said Deputy Mayor Pro Tem Adam Bazaldua (District 7), a member of the City Council’s Economic Development Committee. “While the physical restoration of the Forest Theater is vital, the real value lies in the community collaboration and the lasting positive impact this project will have for generations to come.”The project includes:Comprehensive rehabilitation of the 35,630-square-foot, 75-year-old Forest Theater, in accordance with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation. This will include the 500-seat main theater and lobby;New construction of an approximately 28,000-square-foot building addition to provide more lobby space and a 175-seat black box theater;Additional improvements, such as a café, rooftop deck, lawn for special events, and streetscape enhancements on Harwood Street to support public events and festivals.Upon completion, the redeveloped Forest Theater facility is expected to host more than 140 events annually.“With the support of the City of Dallas, the iconic Forest Theater will shine again in South Dallas. Not only will this investment bring the theater back to life, but it will create jobs, provide vital cultural space for the community, and deliver significant economic benefits,” said Elizabeth Wattley, President and CEO of Forest Forward. “We are grateful for the dedication of the City’s Office of Economic Development and for the continued support of Deputy Mayor Pro Tem Adam Bazaldua.”Forest Forward, a non-profit organization founded in 2020, was created specifically to revitalize the Forest Theater and works closely with the South Dallas community to drive equitable development, economic mobility, and improved outcomes for children, residents, and families. Forest Forward acquired the Forest Theater property in 2021.The City’s $8 million community development grant will include $7 million from the City’s Infrastructure Investment Fund, a funding source established in 2023 to make targeted infrastructure investments in Economic Development Target Areas. The Infrastructure Investment Fund and the Community Development Program are part of new initiatives introduced last year under the City Council’s updated Economic Development and Incentive Policies, designed to address economic disparities and outcomes in historically underserved communities through strategic policy, public investment, and partnership.“Supporting a project like the Forest Theater is a prime example of why the City of Dallas updated its Economic Development Incentive Policy last year,” said Kimberly Bizor Tolbert, Interim City Manager for the City of Dallas. “Providing this funding to a valued non-profit partner like Forest Forward to support the revitalization of the Forest Theater aligns perfectly with the goals of our Office of Economic Development’s Community Development Program, and I’m thrilled that this project will be the first to benefit from our Infrastructure Investment Fund.”",

Photo: Valerie Macon for AFP via Getty Images\n\nLifelong New Yorker and Freakonomics host Stephen Dubner had one question: What's the deal with Dallas and why are so many people moving here?\n\nThe first episode of a two-part series on the appeal of Dallas dropped Wednesday.\n\nWhy it matters: Austin gets a lot of attention for attracting Elon Musk and Joe Rogan. Houston is allegedly more neighborly. But Dallas-Fort Worth is an economic powerhouse that will likely become the nation's third-largest metro area.\n\nDubner's interest was sparked by an article claiming Dallas-Fort Worth has become the \"de facto capital of America's Heartland.\"\n\nThe big picture: The region's population is projected to reach 10 million people in the 2030s, ranking in size behind only New York City and Los Angeles.\n\nWhat they're saying: \"My biggest surprise was not just the massive population growth in the counties just north of Dallas, but the incredible diversity of that growth,\" Dubner tells Axios. He'll delve into that issue next week.\n\nDubner has no plans to move here but says he looks forward to future visits: \"Now all I need to do is arrange to play some golf with Jordan Spieth, which we tried this time but failed.\"\n\nThe intrigue: The episode delves into the council-manager form of government in Dallas, which means the mayor doesn't actually hold much power. Dubner talks to the current mayor, Eric Johnson, and former mayor Laura Miller.\n\n\"Dallas is a wonderful place to live with a totally awful city government,\" Miller says in the episode.\nFreakonomics also doesn't shy away from Dallas' racist history and how segregated the city remains today.\n\nOf note: The coverage isn't all about population and politics. Dubner dedicates a chunk of the first episode to dining at Sonny Bryan's Smokehouse.\n\nHe says the meat potato \"is maybe the best food on earth.\"\n\nHow to listen: Go to freakonomics.com or, you know, wherever you listen to podcasts. The episode will also air soon on KERA.\n\nfacebook (opens in new window)\ntwitter (opens in new window)\nlinkedin (opens in new window)\nnextdoor (opens in new window)\nemail (opens in new window)\n\nGet more local stories in your inbox with Axios Dallas.\n\nSubscribe\nMore Dallas stories\nNews\nMaking Dallas a tourist destination\nMay 9, 2025\nGo deeper (1 min. read)\nPolitics & Policy\nFormer Dallas bishop temporarily leads Catholic Church\nApr 21, 2025\nGo deeper (1 min. read)\nNews\nMore anti-Trump protests planned in Dallas-Fort Worth\nApr 17, 2025\nGo deeper (1 min. read)\nNews\nWhy Dallas-Fort Worth embraces the sprawl\nMay 1, 2025\nGo deeper (2 min. read)\nNews\nWhat's on the May 3 ballot in Dallas-Fort Worth\nApr 30, 2025\nGo deeper (1 min. read)\nMore stories\n\nGet a free daily digest of the most important news in your backyard with Axios Dallas.\n\nSubscribe\n🌱\n\nSupport local journalism by becoming a member.\n\nLearn more",
