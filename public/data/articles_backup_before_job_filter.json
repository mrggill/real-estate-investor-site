The ratings will be finalized in August.\n\nWhat they're doing: The district tells Axios in a statement that it has restructured its literacy and math curriculum and has a new strategic plan that includes academic performance, family engagement, employee retention and operational efficiency.\n\nThe district also has a new superintendent.\n\nThe fine print: State law requires the TEA to take over a district if any of its campuses get an unacceptable rating for five consecutive years.\n\nTakeovers typically replace the elected board of trustees and superintendent with a state-appointed board of managers and can affect students and staff if schools are closed or turned into charters.\nThe TEA decides when to return control to elected trustees.\n\nBetween the lines: It's rare for the state to take control of a school district.\n\nFrom 1993 to 2023, the state took over a school district 15 times, per the Houston Chronicle.\n\nZoom out: Houston ISD has been under state control since 2023 and could stay under state control until at least 2027, per the Texas Standard.\n\nThe state also took over South San Antonio ISD in February, citing years of governance failures and financial mismanagement.\n\nWhat's next: The TEA's 2024 ratings are delayed by a different lawsuit and haven't been released.\n\nfacebook (opens in new window)\ntwitter (opens in new window)\nlinkedin (opens in new window)\nnextdoor (opens in new window)\nemail (opens in new window)\n\nGet more local stories in your inbox with Axios Dallas.\n\nSubscribe\nMore Dallas stories\nNews\nMaking Dallas a tourist destination\nMay 9, 2025\nGo deeper (1 min. read)\nPolitics & Policy\nFormer Dallas bishop temporarily leads Catholic Church\nApr 21, 2025\nGo deeper (1 min. read)\nNews\nMore anti-Trump protests planned in Dallas-Fort Worth\nApr 17, 2025\nGo deeper (1 min. read)\nNews\nWhy Dallas-Fort Worth embraces the sprawl\nMay 1, 2025\nGo deeper (2 min. read)\nNews\nWhat's on the May 3 ballot in Dallas-Fort Worth\nApr 30, 2025\nGo deeper (1 min. read)\nMore stories\n\nGet a free daily digest of the most important news in your backyard with Axios Dallas.\n\nSubscribe\nüå±\n\nSupport local journalism by becoming a member.\n\nLearn more",

Districts said this increased metric would result in unfair drops in their ratings.\nAn appeals court this month cleared the way for the ratings' release.\n\nZoom in: A now-closed Fort Worth school had five consecutive years of failing ratings, putting the district at risk of takeover, per the Star-Telegram.\n\n43 campuses received an F in the newly-released ratings. 10 received an A.

Photo: Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images\n\nWidespread protests against the Trump administration are planned nationwide, including in North Texas, on Saturday.\n\nWhy it matters: The 50501 Movement ‚Äî meaning 50 protests, 50 states, 1 movement ‚Äî is building on momentum from recent protests to push back against what organizers call executive overreach from the Trump administration.\n\n\"Our movement shows the world that the American working class will not sit idly by as plutocrats rip apart their democratic institutions and civil liberties while undermining the rule of law,\" the movement's website said.\n\nDriving the news: More than 400 events are scheduled nationwide for Saturday, including rallies, protests, nature cleanups and food drives.\n\nA protest in Fort Worth is planned for noon-4pm Saturday at Burk Burnett Park.\n\nThe intrigue: Most of the organizing has taken place on Reddit.\n\nBetween the lines: The protests come as President Trump's approval ratings have dipped significantly.\n\nZoom in: Thousands of protesters gathered April 5 across North Texas as part of the nationwide \"Hands Off!\" campaign against Trump's policies and Elon Musk's involvement in the federal government as an unelected official.\n\nProtesters rallied in Arlington, Dallas, Denton, Flower Mound and Frisco.\nFort Worth did not have an organized protest that day, but at least 100 people gathered outside a Tesla dealership, per the Fort Worth Weekly.\n\nContext: Saturday's effort isn't just about protesting.

Nature, like Five Mile Creek, is tucked in there too. Photo: Tasha Tsiaperas/Axios\n\nThe average temperature in Dallas-Fort Worth was nearly 6 degrees warmer than normal last month, per the National Weather Service, but some neighborhoods likely felt much hotter.\n\nWhy it matters: Dallas has mapped its heat islands for two years now, helping city planners determine which neighborhoods need more trees.\n\nConcrete urban settings can make a hot day feel worse, while tree-lined streets and less concrete can have a cooling effect.\n\nThe big picture: Urban heat islands are a problem nationwide, but the burden isn't equally shared. Historically segregated neighborhoods tend to experience higher temperatures than white communities.\n\nResearchers have released reports illustrating heat disparity in other U.S. cities this year, including Charlotte, North Carolina, and Santa Fe, New Mexico.\n\nDriving the news: Lush green space in Dallas was about 12 degrees cooler than the hottest parts of town on Aug. 10, 2024, when the temperature reached 101 degrees.\n\nAn updated joint study by the City of Dallas and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has now mapped 350 square miles of the city over two years to identify the hottest neighborhoods.\n\nWhat they found: Built-up areas around highways and major roads stayed hot throughout the day, whereas neighborhoods near preserved land with a lot of trees on their streets stayed cooler.\n\nThe difference can be seen in North Oak Cliff, where Bishop Arts was hotter than the neighborhood around nearby Stevens Park.\nDowntown, Oak Lawn, the Harwood area, West Dallas and Love Field are among the hottest areas.\n\nThe intrigue: Some Dallas neighborhoods can be in the low 70s at 6am while hotter neighborhoods start the day above 82 degrees.\n\nThreat level: Even with reduced emissions, researchers write, temperatures are still expected to rise in the coming decades.\n\nWith high emissions, the average daily maximum temperature could increase 4 degrees by the 2060s. Even with low emissions, the temperature could rise 2 degrees.\nDallas County could see 10 more days a year with a high over 90 degrees within 20 years.\n\nThe bottom line: City leaders plan to use the data to plant more trees in neighborhoods that have been identified as heat islands.\n\nThe city is already prioritizing adding park space to give every resident access to greenspace within a short walk from their home.\n\nGo deeper: See how hot your neighborhood is.\n\nfacebook (opens in new window)\ntwitter (opens in new window)\nlinkedin (opens in new window)\nnextdoor (opens in new window)\nemail (opens in new window)\n\nGet more local stories in your inbox with Axios Dallas.\n\nSubscribe\nMore Dallas stories\nNews\nMaking Dallas a tourist destination\nMay 9, 2025\nGo deeper (1 min. read)\nPolitics & Policy\nFormer Dallas bishop temporarily leads Catholic Church\nApr 21, 2025\nGo deeper (1 min. read)\nNews\nMore anti-Trump protests planned in Dallas-Fort Worth\nApr 17, 2025\nGo deeper (1 min. read)\nNews\nWhy Dallas-Fort Worth embraces the sprawl\nMay 1, 2025\nGo deeper (2 min. read)\nNews\nWhat's on the May 3 ballot in Dallas-Fort Worth\nApr 30, 2025\nGo deeper (1 min. read)\nMore stories\n\nGet a free daily digest of the most important news in your backyard with Axios Dallas.\n\nSubscribe\nüå±\n\nSupport local journalism by becoming a member.\n\nLearn more",

Photo: Orlando Ramirez/Getty Images\n\nOur Big Dallas Energy has become more D-FW AF ‚Äî to include Arlington and Frisco.\n\nWhy it matters: For a long time, the region has been described by its two most populous cities, but some leaders have suggested the name \"Dallas-Fort Worth\" should be more inclusive of the region's explosive growth.\n\nState of play: Frisco Mayor Jeff Cheney recently made a reference to \"DFFW,\" a term used to describe North Texas as Dallas, Frisco and Fort Worth.\n\n\"We're well on our way to being like an Austin, bringing these startups. We're becoming kind of the epicenter for that. Certainly, we're a global city,\" the mayor said at an event where he talked about the city's growth.\nThe Dallas Sports Commission refers to the region as \"DFW-AF\" as it prepares for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, executive director Monica Paul said at a separate event hosted by D Magazine last month.\n\"It takes everybody and every city ‚Äî but it's also the conferences, the universities, our corporations, the facilities, and our leagues and teams here,\" Paul said.\n\nFlashback: Last year, Arlington Mayor Jim Ross disagreed with FIFA's decision to rename AT&T Stadium to Dallas Stadium for the nine World Cup matches that will be hosted there.\n\n\"Dallas is the big boy in the metroplex, and we love and appreciate everything Dallas does, but Arlington brings millions of millions of people here. To come in and call this Dallas Stadium doesn't do justice for who we are,\" Ross told the DMN.\n\nReality check: Plano could use more love, too.

    "content": "On December 11, the Dallas City Council unanimously approved a $49 million incentive package to support the development of the West End Lofts Project, a proposed mixed-use, mixed-income, and transit-oriented development project. The project will be developed on three existing parcels within the historic West End addressed as 805 Elm Street, 711 Elm Street, and 211 N. Austin Street within and adjacent to the City Center tax increment financing (TIF) district. The proposed project, led by Sycamore Strategies, LLC, is directly south of the West End DART light rail station and directly north of El Centro (Dallas College).¬†‚ÄúThis is an exciting project that will convert underutilized/vacant historic buildings and surface parking lots into active residential and commercial uses abutting the West End DART light rail station and across the street from El Centro College,‚Äù said City Councilmember Paul Ridley (District 14), a member of the City Council‚Äôs Economic Development Committee. Council Member Ridley added, ‚ÄúWith the reconstruction and expansion of the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center and impactful projects such as West End Lofts, we can expect to see significant positive changes to the west side of downtown Dallas over the next several years.‚Äù¬†The estimated $103.2 million project will include 154 mixed-income apartments comprised of 56 efficiencies, 25 one-bedroom, 69 two-bedroom, and 4 three-bedroom units to be constructed within the historic 805 Elm Street building and in a new 6-story building to be constructed on the existing adjacent surface parking lot. Of the 154 apartments, 63 (41%) will be income-restricted and leased solely to households earning at or below 30%, 60%, 70%, and 80% area family median income. Additionally, the project will include the development of residential amenities, rehabilitation of approximately 26,462 gross square feet of ground floor retail/commercial space, creation of an approximately 25,751 square foot plaza and promenade (open space), and rehabilitation of approximately 140 parking spaces in the historic 711 Elm Street parking garage.¬†The project‚Äôs funding includes $54,224,085 in non-City sources, including equity in the form of low income housing tax credits and historic rehabilitation tax credits. The City‚Äôs incentive package includes an amount not to exceed $28,275,676 in City Center TIF District funding as well as up to $20,724,324 from other economic development funding sources administered by the City‚Äôs Office of Economic Development, including general obligation bond proceeds from the economic development/housing propositions in the City‚Äôs 2012 and 2024 bond programs. ¬†\"The West End Lofts development is about more than apartments to us. It is a chance to revitalize and transform an area of downtown with a brand new pedestrian plaza, street-level retail, workforce housing and the preservation of two pieces of Dallas history,\" said Zachary Krochtengel of Sycamore Strategies. \"The City of Dallas has been an essential and invaluable partner to us, and we are extremely grateful for their support.\"‚ÄúThe City‚Äôs dedication to working with the West End Lofts Project development team is a prime example of how public-private partnerships can bring meaningful development to areas in need of an economic development boost,‚Äù said Kimberly Bizor Tolbert, Interim City Manager for the City of Dallas. ‚ÄúThis important project will provide much needed affordable housing and ground floor activation within downtown‚Äôs West End Historic District. Prior to City Council consideration of the City subsidy for the project, the City Center TIF District Board of Directors unanimously recommended the use of City Center TIF District funding for this project, with the added condition that best efforts be made to provide a minimum of two square feet per residential unit for pet relief facilities. It is exciting to think of adding housing stock that will be occupied with individuals, families, and their pets, helping to grow the live-work-play spirit of downtown Dallas.‚Äù",

Forest Forward has already invested over $15 million in selective demolition and environmental remediation efforts.‚ÄúThis project is revitalizing a cherished community asset, and its significance extends far beyond the theater itself,‚Äù said Deputy Mayor Pro Tem Adam Bazaldua (District 7), a member of the City Council‚Äôs Economic Development Committee. ‚ÄúWhile the physical restoration of the Forest Theater is vital, the real value lies in the community collaboration and the lasting positive impact this project will have for generations to come.‚ÄùThe project includes:Comprehensive rehabilitation of the 35,630-square-foot, 75-year-old Forest Theater, in accordance with the Secretary of the Interior‚Äôs Standards for Rehabilitation. This will include the 500-seat main theater and lobby;New construction of an approximately 28,000-square-foot building addition to provide more lobby space and a 175-seat black box theater;Additional improvements, such as a caf√©, rooftop deck, lawn for special events, and streetscape enhancements on Harwood Street to support public events and festivals.Upon completion, the redeveloped Forest Theater facility is expected to host more than 140 events annually.‚ÄúWith the support of the City of Dallas, the iconic Forest Theater will shine again in South Dallas. Not only will this investment bring the theater back to life, but it will create jobs, provide vital cultural space for the community, and deliver significant economic benefits,‚Äù said Elizabeth Wattley, President and CEO of Forest Forward. ‚ÄúWe are grateful for the dedication of the City‚Äôs Office of Economic Development and for the continued support of Deputy Mayor Pro Tem Adam Bazaldua.‚ÄùForest Forward, a non-profit organization founded in 2020, was created specifically to revitalize the Forest Theater and works closely with the South Dallas community to drive equitable development, economic mobility, and improved outcomes for children, residents, and families. Forest Forward acquired the Forest Theater property in 2021.The City‚Äôs $8 million community development grant will include $7 million from the City‚Äôs Infrastructure Investment Fund, a funding source established in 2023 to make targeted infrastructure investments in Economic Development Target Areas. The Infrastructure Investment Fund and the Community Development Program are part of new initiatives introduced last year under the City Council‚Äôs updated Economic Development and Incentive Policies, designed to address economic disparities and outcomes in historically underserved communities through strategic policy, public investment, and partnership.‚ÄúSupporting a project like the Forest Theater is a prime example of why the City of Dallas updated its Economic Development Incentive Policy last year,‚Äù said Kimberly Bizor Tolbert, Interim City Manager for the City of Dallas. ‚ÄúProviding this funding to a valued non-profit partner like Forest Forward to support the revitalization of the Forest Theater aligns perfectly with the goals of our Office of Economic Development‚Äôs Community Development Program, and I‚Äôm thrilled that this project will be the first to benefit from our Infrastructure Investment Fund.‚Äù",

Photo: Valerie Macon for AFP via Getty Images\n\nLifelong New Yorker and Freakonomics host Stephen Dubner had one question: What's the deal with Dallas and why are so many people moving here?\n\nThe first episode of a two-part series on the appeal of Dallas dropped Wednesday.\n\nWhy it matters: Austin gets a lot of attention for attracting Elon Musk and Joe Rogan. Houston is allegedly more neighborly. But Dallas-Fort Worth is an economic powerhouse that will likely become the nation's third-largest metro area.\n\nDubner's interest was sparked by an article claiming Dallas-Fort Worth has become the \"de facto capital of America's Heartland.\"\n\nThe big picture: The region's population is projected to reach 10 million people in the 2030s, ranking in size behind only New York City and Los Angeles.\n\nWhat they're saying: \"My biggest surprise was not just the massive population growth in the counties just north of Dallas, but the incredible diversity of that growth,\" Dubner tells Axios. He'll delve into that issue next week.\n\nDubner has no plans to move here but says he looks forward to future visits: \"Now all I need to do is arrange to play some golf with Jordan Spieth, which we tried this time but failed.\"\n\nThe intrigue: The episode delves into the council-manager form of government in Dallas, which means the mayor doesn't actually hold much power. Dubner talks to the current mayor, Eric Johnson, and former mayor Laura Miller.\n\n\"Dallas is a wonderful place to live with a totally awful city government,\" Miller says in the episode.\nFreakonomics also doesn't shy away from Dallas' racist history and how segregated the city remains today.\n\nOf note: The coverage isn't all about population and politics. Dubner dedicates a chunk of the first episode to dining at Sonny Bryan's Smokehouse.\n\nHe says the meat potato \"is maybe the best food on earth.\"\n\nHow to listen: Go to freakonomics.com or, you know, wherever you listen to podcasts.
