In this context, deregulated markets such as ERCOT have garnered interest as increasingly flexible markets.In a departure from convention where price competitiveness led locations decisions, today’s site selectors are placing primary emphasis on certainty and speed of access to power. This shift reflects the outsized demands of data centers, electrified manufacturing, and energy-intensive logistics operations—industries where timelines for connection are frequently deal-bre vestment.As the demands of industry evolve, water infrastructure has emerged as a central factor in the site selection process. Sectors such as semiconductor fabrication, food processing, and next-generation battery manufacturing are fundamentally constrained by their access to reliable water resources in the near and long term. Beyond volumetric supply, companies are evaluating long-term sustainability, permitting complexity, and regional governance structures. States and municipalities capable of articulating a proactive natural resource strategy—one that balances industrial usage, population growth, and ecological resilience—will be positioned to capture the next wave of transformational in site selection—logistics, labor, and incentive remain central, the dialogue has evolved. Increasingly, conversations are oriented around certainty in infrastructure, environmental resilience, and AI integration. In this context, Fort Worth stands out—not only for its quantitative strengths, but also for a culture built on trust, responsiveness, and collaboration. As investment priorities shift toward speed, certainty, and sustainability, Fort Worth and Texas offer both the capabilities and the relationships that advance strategic growth.While the traditional pillars of",
